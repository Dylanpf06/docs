Once you've signed up, you can start deploying your applications on DS Cloud after selecting the plan that suits your needs.

## Facilitating your journey with web interface üòâ
If you prefer to use our Discord-based hosting system, follow these steps to deploy your application:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join the DS Cloud Discord server">
    Access our [DS Cloud Discord server](https://discord.gg/dscloud) and ensure your account is linked.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare your files">
    Ensure you have a zipped project folder and a correctly configured `dscloud.config` file. Refer to our [configuration guide](/getting-started/config-file) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the upload command">
    In the Discord server, go to the `#commands` channel and use the `/up` command. The bot will prompt you to upload your zip file and the `dscloud.config` file. Simply drag and drop both files into the response field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your project">
    Once the files are uploaded, the bot will handle the deployment process. You‚Äôll receive a confirmation message with details about your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>
