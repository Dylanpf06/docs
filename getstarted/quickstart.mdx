  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your DS Cloud config file.">
    Create a configuration file for your project. You can learn how to create a [configuration file](/getting-started/config-file) by reading this article [here](/getting-started/config-file).
 
    ```systemd Example of a config file for a bot
    MAIN=index.js
    MEMORY=512
    VERSION=recommended
    DISPLAY_NAME=Batman Bot
    DESCRIPTION=This bot is the dark knight of the night.
    ```

    VERSION=recommended
    SUBDOMAIN=batman
    START=npm run build && npm run start
    DISPLAY_NAME=Batman Website
    DESCRIPTION=This website is the dark knight of the night.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="ZIP your project.">
    After creating the configuration file, zip your project using the steps below:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Windows
      1. Locate the file or folder that you want to zip.
      2. Right-click the file or folder, select "Send to," and then select "Compressed (zipped) folder."
      3. A new zipped folder will be created in the same location. To rename it, right-click the folder, select "Rename," and then type the new name.
      ```
      ```bash Linux
      1. Locate the file or folder that you want to zip.
      2. Right-click the file or folder, then choose "Compress" from the shortcut menu.

      ```
    </CodeGroup>
   </Step>
  <Step title="Finally, upload your project. üòâ">
    Make sure your project folder is zipped. Go to the channel #commands and use the command `/up`.  
    The bot will ask you to upload your zip file. Drag and drop it into the response field.  

    After uploading the file, the bot will deploy your project. You‚Äôll get a confirmation message with your application details.
