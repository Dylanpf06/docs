## üöÄ Introduction

- Ensure Java is installed on your system. If not, download it from the [official Java website](https://www.java.com/download/manual.jsp).
- Create an account on DS Cloud via the [login page](https://dscloud.app/login) using your email, Discord, or both.
- Make sure you have an active paid plan. View and purchase plans [here](https://dscloud.app/plans).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Creating the dscloud config file

<Card
title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for DS Cloud."
icon="link"
href="https://docs.dscloud.app/getting-started/config-file"
>
  The `dscloud.app` file configures your application, defining its name, description, version, main file, and more.
</Card>

## üìÑ Required Files

- `project.jar` (main application file).
- `MANIFEST.MF` (dependency file).
- [dscloud.app/.config](/getting-started/config-file) (DS Cloud configuration file).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Application

- If the `START` field is not defined in the configuration file, DS Cloud will run `java -jar MAIN`, where `MAIN` is the file specified in the `MAIN` field of the configuration file. If the `START` field is defined, its value will be executed directly. Learn more about configuration file parameters [here](https://docs.dscloud.app/getting-started/config-file#configuration-parameters).

## üñ•Ô∏è Preparing Your Java Project

Before hosting your project on DS Cloud, ensure your project files are correctly configured and ready for deployment.

<Warning>
  The configuration file (`dscloud.app/.config`) must be located in the root of the zip file; otherwise, DS Cloud won't find it during deployment.
</Warning>

### üìÑ Required Files for Deployment

- [dscloud.app/.config](/getting-started/config-file)
- Main application file (`project.jar`)
- Dependency file (`MANIFEST.MF`)

## üí° Troubleshooting

  <Accordion
title="Invalid or Corrupted Main File"

>
    Ensure the `MAIN` field in the configuration file correctly points to your `JAR` file. For files in subfolders, use the format `folder/file.jar`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Insufficient Memory" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    Minimum RAM requirements:
    - Bots: 256MB
    - Websites/APIs: 512MB
    Depending on your application's size and complexity, allocate more RAM to avoid the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.dscloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
